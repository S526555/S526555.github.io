    I am a Senior majoring in Computer Science 

    <section>
<h2>Current</h2>
 I am a Senior Computer Science major. I will be graduating this Spring. 
 I'm running 18 credit hours this semester, with, hopefully, just 13 in my final term. 
 My current track is just to get my BS in Computer Science and be done with college for the foreseeable future. 

<h2>Past</h2>
In the past I have done local network and Information Technology support. 
Here at Northwest as a Technology Support Assistant I worked the Fall and Spring term of my Sophomore year.
 I did two years of volunteer service doing similar services for my high school while still in school and again, as a paid employee last winter. 
 Hobbies include building custom Personal Computers for friends and family, in the small town of Hamburg Iowa (recently just out of the flooding from this summer). 
 In between my current job as a Casey's Employee in my local town, and being a student at Northwest, I play video games on a system I also built from after my high school graduation. 

 <h2>Future</h2>
As far as planning goes, currently I'm just kind of going with the flow. 
I've put out applications during Sophomore and Junior year with no internships opening up. 
Hopefully that changes this year or after graduation so I can have something planned. 
I hope to be either programming for a company or doing infrastructure management as working with and troubleshooting networks always interested me;
 and I have experience having to hunt down down faults in central servers and reboot/troubleshoot equipment on the fly.
